# DAOlanders 

This project is a DAO focused on investing together to play games and earn money. Once you create a DAO, you will be provided a land and a God to worship, play with and earn rewards. More the people in the DAO, higher the rewards. People can interact with each other in the DAO giving a feel of metaverse. These super attractive Gods are completely made from scratch by our team. Here's the twist, you can't worship a God forever! You can list Gods in the market place and get a completely unique God with new abilities for FREE just like that! There are 5 levels of rarity which adds more fun and exciting opportunities.

### How it's made
We had a blueprint of using a lot of tech stacks for our project but we couldn't find enough time to connect all the blocks. We used polygon to deploy our contracts on the mumbai testnet. We used Chainlink VRF to generate a number to mint random NFTs. We uploaded all our NFTs and Metadata in IPFS through Pinata. We used WakuConnect to chat with people within the DAO. We used Coinbase and Wallet Connect to connect the wallet with the Dapp. We deployed our Dapp in Spheron network. We used SketchBook to draw our NFTs and we used Solidity to write our contracts and we developed our dApp using React.js.
