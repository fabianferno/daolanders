We had a blueprint of using a lot of tech stacks for our project but we couldn't find enough time to connect all the blocks. We used polygon to deploy our contracts on the mumbai testnet. We used Chainlink VRF to generate a number to mint random NFTs. We uploaded all our NFTs and Metadata in IPFS through Pinata. We used WakuConnect to chat with people within the DAO. We used Coinbase and Wallet Connect to connect the wallet with the Dapp. We deployed our Dapp in Spheron network. We used SketchBook to draw our NFTs and we used Solidity to write our contracts and we developed our dApp using React.js.
